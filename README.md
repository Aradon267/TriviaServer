# Magshimim's Trivia Project(server-side)
This is the final project on the second year of "Magshimim".

The server supports multiple users playing simoltaniously toghether or in different game rooms.

There are more things that needs to be added like user statistics and better design.

The project also has a GUI that connects to this server that you can get by [clicking here](https://github.com/Aradon267/TriviaGUI).
